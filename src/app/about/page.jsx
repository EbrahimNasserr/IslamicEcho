        "ISLAM is derived from the Arabic root SALEMA: peace, purity, submission, and obedience. In the religious sense, Islam means submission to the will of God and obedience to His law.",
        "Everything and every phenomenon in the world, other than man, is administered TOTALLY by God-made laws i.e., they are obedient to God and submissive to His laws i.e., they are in the STATE OF ISLAM. Man possesses the quality of intelligence and choice; thus, he is invited to submit to the good will of God and obey His law i.e., become a Muslim. Submission to the good will of God, together with obedience to His beneficial law, i.e., becoming a Muslim, is the best safeguard for man's peace and harmony.",
        "Islam dates back to the edge of Adam and its message has been conveyed to man by Godâ€™s Prophets and Messengers including Abrahim, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad. Islam's message has been restored and enforced in the last stage of the religious evolution by God's last Prophet and Messenger Muhammad.",

He gives them peace, happiness, knowledge, and success. God is the Loving and the Provider, the Generous, and the Benevolent, the Rich and the Independent, the Forgiving and the Clement, the Patient and the Appreciative, the Unique and the Protector, the Judge and the Peace.
